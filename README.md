# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PERSONAL ASSISTANT (AIPA)

AIPA (A.I. Personal Assistant) is Speech, Vision and IoT Based Intelligent Personal Assistant.

AIPA is a speech, vision and iot based intelligent personal assistant inspired by [JARVIS](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10154361492931634/). The project is released under MIT license, I would love to have your help on improving AIPA, and see [CONTRIBUTING]() for more details.
