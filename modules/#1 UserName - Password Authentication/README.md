*username* and *password* were already initialized (at line 22 and line 23), change them with your custom *username* and *password*.

    username = "admin"	      #that's the given username
    password = "admin_123456" #that's the given password

Login is successfull when program reaches the Line 39, you should add your codes after the line 39 to manage your program (in other words, add your codes after the line 39 for specifying what program do when login is successful).
