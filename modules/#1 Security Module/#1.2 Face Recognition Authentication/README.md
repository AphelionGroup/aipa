Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library. Built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of **99.38%** on the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark. This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line! [1]

The Multi-View Face Recognition is not providing now, it is in developing progress. However, it will be published soon!
